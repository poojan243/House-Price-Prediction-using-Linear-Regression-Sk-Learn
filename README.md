# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

## This project demonstrates the use of linear regression for predicting house prices using the scikit-learn library in Python. The model is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation of the model's performance.

## Overview
### The main steps in this project are:

1. Data Loading: Importing the house prices dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Scaling/normalizing the training data.
3. Model Training: Creating and fitting a Linear Regression model using Gradient Descent.
4.  Prediction: Making predictions on the training data.
5. Evaluation: Comparing the predicted values with the target values.
6. Visualization: Plotting predictions versus target values for better understanding.

## Goals

1. Utilize scikit-learn to implement linear regression using Gradient Descent.
2. Understand the process of normalizing input data and its impact on model parameters.
